## Pharmacy Medication Tracker
This site allows a pharmacy corporation with multiple pharmacies to track the amount of each medication (with different strengths entered separately) received and the amounts dispensed. They thus know when a reorder of the medication is necessary. Only authorized users can sign up and login. An authorized user can only sign up or log in if he or she has been given the code of that particular day that allows them to proceed with the sign up or log in.

## Usage
To begin using this site, fork the code from github, run bundle install, type “rails s” and press "Enter".  You can then proceed to the appropriate local host (usually 3000 if using rails) and press “Enter”. The homepage will then be seen and one can choose to sign up (if this is the first time the site is being accessed) or log in (if the site has been visited before). A person can also sign up or log in utilizing Google or Facebook. Please note that any method utilized to enter the site necessitates knowing the code which is only made known to authorized users and is changed regularly. Once you are logged in, you will have access to the navigation bar which allows you to see, edit, create, and delete medications,patients, pharmacies, and prescriptions. The prescriptions area allows the creation of and modification of the first three items at once.
